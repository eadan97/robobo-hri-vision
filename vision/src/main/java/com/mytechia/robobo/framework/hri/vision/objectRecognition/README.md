# Object recognition module

The Robobo object recognition module uses a Tensorflow Lite model to detect and recognize multiple objects in real time in the images captured by the camera.

The module provides the following data about the detected objects:

- label: Label of the object
- posx/posY: Coordinates of the center of the object
- hidth/height: Width and Height of the bounding box
- confidence: Level of confidence of the detection

By default, the object recognition module uses a basic tflite model that detects 100 types of assorted objects. 
You can add your custom models by dropping your detect.tflite and labelmap.txt files in a folder located in "/properties" in the phone internal memory.
The model must be trained for a 300x300 input image.

To import the module in your Robobo application you must declare the module in the modules.properties file:

robobo.module.#MODULE_NUMBER#=com.mytechia.robobo.framework.hri.vision.objectRecognition.tensorFlow.TensorFlowObjectRecognizerModule
